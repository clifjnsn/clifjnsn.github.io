# Choosing, Protecting, Changing, and Managing Passwords

### Brief History of Passwords
Early in the days of computing, the numbers of people who had access to (either physical, or remotely) a computer system was generally small.  Protecting your files and data was as simple a task as choosing a good one, and keeping it safe.  What was defined as a "good" password was pretty basic:  longer than 8 characters, not contain a word in the dictionary, and add a couple numbers or special characters.  There were no concerns of hackers from distant countries, trying to guess our username/password combinations while we slept (or better yet, using a computer program to try every combination of letters, numbers, symbols, or words from a dictionary) to gain access to our files/data.  Today, everything is "online" - meaning, connected to the internet.  This allows anyone with an internet connection, time, and incentive (and very few morals), the opportunity to try and become us (exposing our data, stealing or money, or our identity).

### Passwords are Like Underwear
This is a phrase/concept that was created many years ago, to try and enable users of computers (but who were not IT people) to realize the importance of :
- keeping your password hidden
- changing your password often
- not sharing your password with your friends

While humorous, these are good suggestions (for both passwords, and underwear).  But, our online lives have become much more complex, and the hackers, much more sophisticated.  Most of us no longer have 1 or 2 usernames/passwords to remember, guard, and change - we may have hundreds: computer, cell phone, utilities, bank, email, online shopping, frequent shopper rewards, social media, etc.  Most people will choose a password that they think is really good, memorize it, and then use the same one everywhere.  Now, imagine your really good password becomes compromised (someone hacks it, figures it out, or watches you type it): that person now has access to every account you used that password for, and you are racing them to beat them to your accounts and change it before they login and lock you out of your own accounts.

### Saving Passwords in the Browser
"That won't happen to me, as I use a different password at every site, and I let my browser remember them for me".  Well, that's a great start.  Having a different password for each account is important to prevent the scenario above, but how good are those passwords, and what it your computer crashes and you lose those passwords that are stored in your browser?  You might think you are 1-step ahead of me again, and point out that you use Google Chrome, and it you allow it to sync all of your passwords, settings, bookmarks, etc. to your Google account.  My final question to you: "Did you assign a really good Master Password - or any Master Password at all?".  See, without that password, your passwords aren't encrypted when stored on Google's servers, and if anyone gained access to your Google account (or your browser when you are already logged in), they can view/copy all of your saved usernames and passwords - for later use.

### The Solution
The best solution is to use a Password Manager.  A Password Manager is a piece of software, that allows you to securely store your usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other important information, encrypts this data, and stores it in a safe place (only decrypting it when you enter your Master Password).  This software can also be used to generate very secure, random, passwords, that you will never have to remember, as the Password Manager will provide it to the website when needed (only after you enter your Master Password).  A Password Manager gives you the ability to have a unique, secure, password for every account you have, and only requires you to remember your one Master Password (reserving plenty of brain power for you to make that one really good).

### Choosing a Master Password
I'll keep this short.  Passwords should not be guessable, so they should never contain words found in a dictionary, or any information about you personally (as someone can use things like your birthday, anniversary, graduation date, pet names, etc. to guess your passwords).  My suggestion for creating a really good Master Password that is not hackable, yet is memorable is to take a Bible verse, quote from a book, or a words to a song, and use only the first letter of each word from the chosen sentences (including punctuation), and capitalization.  For example:

"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."  from 1 Corinthians 13:1

Using this verse, I would create a password of: TIswttomaoa,ahnc,Iabasb,oatc.

That, is a very good, unguessable, secure password.  How do you remember it?  By memorizing the verse, or the section of the song, and repeating it to yourself as you type it.  For shorter verses, you can add the reference number to add complexity to the password:  TLims;Isnw.Ps23:1   would be a good example of Psalm 23:1, "The LORD is my Shepherd; I shall not want."

### Choosing a Password Manager
There are several good Password Manager's on the market, but my recommendation is [Lastpass](https://lastpass.com).  Lastpass will generate secure passwords for each of your sites, store them in an encrypted vault on your computer, and make a copy of that vault on their servers, allowing all of your devices (computer, laptop, cellphone, browser) to download that encrypted vault.  This vault is not readable by any employee at Lastpass, and is only readable by you (with your Master Password).  

To add even more security to your encrypted vault, Lastpass allows you to restrict access to it (even when using your Master Password) from individuals countries, and certain types of devices.  So, if you know you will never travel outside of the United States, Lastpass can prevent computers from anywhere outside of the United States from even attempting to open your encrypted vault (not even one guess allowed).  Be careful, not to lock yourself out by visiting Canada, or Mexico, for vacation, and then remembering about this restriction you enabled!  You can also (and should) use the Lastpass Authenticator app mentioned in the previous class to further secure your Master Password and Lastpass vault.

** A Word of Caution:  Once you start using Lastpass, do *not* forget your Master Password.  If you do, there is no recovery of your data stored in your encrypted vault.  If you fear that you might forget that password, write it down on a piece of paper, and store it in a locked firebox.
