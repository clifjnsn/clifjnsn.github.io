<h1 align="center"> Protecting Your Personal Computer </h>

# More Than Install an Anti-Virus Application
I am starting out with information about protecting your Personal Computer, not because it is what you might use the most often, but because the concepts for protecting this computer will be much simpler than the concepts for protecting your Smart Phone - but we will get there in future classes.

# History of Connectivity
In the early 1980's, most computers in American households were not on the internet, or at least, they were not connected for very long.  Internet connectivity was a paid service, and the speed at which we connected, we were prevented from being connected 24/7, and there were not enough services where we could've spent that many hours.  During this period of time, Cyber-Security and hacking were happening, but on a very small scale, not for profit, and usually the target was some sort of govermental agency.

Today, our connections are 24/7, and very, very fast.  This enables anyone in the world, to attempt to connect to any server, website, or home computer in the world.  This massive increase in targets has enabled large numbers of people/groups to spend much time online, learning, practicing, and attempting to break into anything attahed to the internet.  These attacks can take many forms, and for various motives.  Also, as spying between governments has evolved, the internet has played a large role in gathering information about enemies, allies, and their citizens.  This surveilance has grown in scope, for the United States, to include it's own citizens.  The NSA has agreements with most communications, and tech., companies to scan, collect, and save most of the SMS/Text messages, emails, and phone records for every communication within the United States, and many of the countries around the world.  The logic for such are large survelance system is to protect the United States from enemies within, and abroad.  The danger is that with much power, comes much responsibility.  Our government hasn't shown itself to handle responsibility of this information, and power, very well - especially in that past few years.

# Home Network / Computer

I'm sure most of you are not currently on the NSA radar (yet), but every American is seen as wealthy by the citizens/groups of most every other nation in the world, and are often the target of phishing and hacking, in order to gain access to bank accounts, or to hold data hostage, until a ransom is paid.

Whether your home computer is a Desktop, or a Laptop, and whether your operating system is Windows, OS/X (Apple), or someting else (Linux), these items will protect you from getting hacked, or tracked online:

- Make certain to keep your operating system current (download and install updates, reboot when they are applied)
- Make certain the firewall on your modem and router is enabled, and running the most current software
- Protect your personal data (browsing history, perferences, likes/dislikes) by using the correct browser and search engine
- Be careful and wise about the links you click on (especially ones in your email)
