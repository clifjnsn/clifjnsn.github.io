# You're Only as Safe as Your Last Backup

### Purpose of Backups
Like choosing good passwords, and changing them often, we all know that we should have backups - but most people don't perform any.

There are many, many articles and tutorials on backups online, so I won't rehash any of that here.  Instead, I would like to look an overview of some newer reasons to make backups, and point out a few items you may not be aware of, and then make a couple of recommendations.

### Modern Threats
We all know that accidents happen, and hardware can fail.  Historically, this has been the justification to make certain backups of files/data are done.

As Cyber threats increase, new reasons for having backups have come to our attention.  Ransomware:  This is a term that you may have heard, but allow me to explain it from a technical point of view, and motivations for its use.

Ransom: The release of property or a person in return for payment of a demanded price

Ransomware is software, that encrypts the data on your hard drive and holds it hostage until you pay to have it decrypted.  This new Cyber Attack is motivated by large sums of money, usually paid by anonymous Crypto currencies, like Bitcoin.  The targets are generally smaller organizations (schools, police stations, small businesses, small hospitals and doctor's offices) who have a lot to lose, and generally don't have the IT resources to plan/defend against this type of attack.  The number of attacks/attempts have been increasing since 2015, and so are the ransoms.  In 2018, the average ransom amount was $5,000, and has increased steadily to around $200,000 in 2021 - with some ransoms against small city governments and healthcare institutions demanding millions.

### Recommendations
Following the guidelines in the class should allow you to steer clear of Ransomware, but there are no guarantees.  If you do find yourself in a situation where all of your hard work, or years of family photos, are being held hostage by some faceless hacker, sitting miles away from law enforcement, you need to be ready to minimize the amount of data you will lose, and thus making you less likely to cash out your retirement to try and recover this data (if the hacker actually decrypts it as promised).

If you have your data safely backed up, you won't be forced to make a catastrophic choice like that: you (or someone who charges much less) will simply format the hard drive to remove all traces of the ransomware, install the operating system, applications, and then restore from your backups.  That may not sound simple, but it is much simpler than the cost of paying the ransom.

If you choose to use an external hard drive for your backups, make certain that you automate the backup process, and rotate our your hard drive so that at least one is stored in a fireproof safe, or another location.  Again, there are many resources available to assist you in choosing a backup software and automation configuration to meet your needs (no matter the operating system you are using).

Another option is to utilize backup software which handles the automation planning for you, and stores it a location other than your home.  This type of "Cloud Backup" software will store you data on servers "in the cloud", which is another way of saying, it is stored on a networked server, that someone else owns/controls, and is accessible from the internet.  The convenience of this option makes it really tempting for most people, and it is probably the best direction, so long as you remember to take great precautions to protect your data from the prying eyes of others (including your own government).  What does that mean?  it means making certain that your files/data are stored, in an encrypted format, so that, even if that "cloud" server is hacked, or subpoenaed by an over reaching prosecute, your data will be unreadable.

There are ways to encrypt your own files/data and store them on cloud storage services like Google Drive, or Dropbox, as well as full featured Backup/Archiving services who will handle all of this in the background for you.  As you make your decision, be careful to choose one who is up front about what they log, what access they have to, and how they will respond if forced by a court.

My recommendation for a quality product, that provides high levels of security ("zero knowledge"), is OneBackup by SpiderOak.  They also publish a "Transparency Report" to let everyone know if any court orders, subpoenas, search warrants, or other data demands have been received, and how many of each: [Report](https://spideroak.com/transparency/).  Their backups may seem to take longer than one would expect, but what they accomplish is amazing.  Your data is analyzed to find which files have changed, each changed file encrypted with a Master Key, and sent to your account on their servers (maintaining a database of all of these changed files/blocks), so that you can restore a single file, from a specific date.
