### Security
The 4th Ammendment of the United States Constitution was added to the Bill of Rights in order to protect its citizens against illegal searches/seizures, and warrants without probable cause.  This is more easily enforced in the physical world, than in the digital world.  Right now, we are the most tracked, and spied upon peoples on this planet - and the "all seeing eye" is not from a foreign nation, but from our own.  How do we then, prevent this spying on every financial transaction, and protect against the illegal seizure of our property/finances?

### Crypto-Currency
I am not one who jumps on every new fad (technical or otherwise), and honestly, I didn't "get" the point (and the hype) of this new thing called Crypto Currency (of which, Bitcoin is one).  Currently, most people are "investing" in Crypto Currency to produce a profit (either long term investing, or day trading).  Both of these activities ignore the reason for the creation of Crypto, and how to properly use it.  I paid no attention to Crypto, and in my mind, so no reason to "invest" in something which was only digital (and didn't really exist).  I understood the benefit of the Blockchain, and it's application in contracts, inventory tracking, and even as a balance sheet, but not as a currency.

### Crypto Does Not Always Equal Private
There is a very large misconception in Crypto (whose name comes from Cryptography, which means to hide, or conceal) - it is assumed that Bitcoin is private, and secure.  It is not.  One of the "advantages" of the Blockchain, is that it is unchangeable, public, and transparent.  This is great when the people ask of it's governments where the money (taxes) is being spent - but not so great when the government asks (or looks) where the citizens money is (or has gone).  There are Crypto Coins which remedy that, and they are called "Private Coins".

### Wallets
A Wallet is a digital location (with a long, sophisticated/unique address) from which, and to which, Crypto Currency can be transacted.  When you download a piece of software, purchase a physical "hardware" wallet, or open an account at an online exchange, you are assigned one of the wallet addresses.  You can have multiple addresses, and create them at will - in the mistaken belief that if you do this, you add privacy to your transactions, and your transactions cannot be tracked (you would be mistaken).

### Cash
The biggest advantage to cash is that, when you spend it (or receive it), it cannot be tracked from person to person (or, at least not easily, and not in every physical location).  The obvious downsides are: it can be lost, destroyed, or stolen (it also loses value each day, due to inflation, and other poor political financial decisions).

### Bitcoin Ledgers
The reason Bitcoin (or any other digital currency based on it) isn't anonymous/private (like cash) is because this blockchain records every transaction to/from each wallet, is viewable online (at places like blockchain.com), and, computers can quickly analyze all of the transacations to/from every wallet, and determine from whom, or to whom, any financial transaction occured.  You may have heard lately about discussions to convert central banks (like the Federal Reserve) into a digital US Dollar currency, making cash a thing of the past.  The media tells of the advantages: security, safe from germs/COVID, and private, but the reason the governments of the world would like digital currency is because it is so easy to track.  Crypto Currency is secure - no one can move money out of your digital wallet, unless they have your "seed phrase", which is a randomly generated list of 12 to 24 words, which is needed to open the wallet.  This "seed phrase" is 256 characters, so, it is probably the best password you will ever have (your online bank would be easier to hack than your Bitcoin Wallet) - but, if you lose this "seed phrase" any money in that wallet is no longer accessible.

### Dangers 
Since some very smart people have found ways to circumvent many of these biometric access mechanisms, it is not a very good idea to utilize them to access your phone, computer, home, vehicle, or safes.  Also, you cannot change your eye, face, or fingerprint (so if your identity is compromised/stolen, you cannot simply change something about your body, like you can do with a password or PIN).  By avoiding Biometrics to access your phone, you can prevent unintended access (or coercion) as you are less likely to be coerced into giving someone your PIN instead of having your finger placed on your phone against your will (or while you are sleeping).

Another danger:  Keeping your Crypto Currency at an exchange (which isn't a bank, but a clearning house).  It this exchange is hacked, robbed, or goes out of business, your wallet goes with them.  Exchanges do not give you full access to your wallet (the full seed phrase), but either use your username/password, or a shorter seed phrase, to open your wallet.  The exchange retains the full Seed Phrase, and so, if you don't own the keys, you don't own the Crypto.  Most recently, read about the collapse of FTX.

### Solution (Private Coins)
If you would like your financial transactions to be private, then I would suggest using Private Coins.  Private Coins use additional cryptography, and security measures, to hide information on the block chain, so that, the transacations aren't so public/transparent, and the amounts of each transaction are hidden, and possibly sub-accounts (which route to your digital wallet) are used (instead of making your actual digital wallet address known to the public).  One such Private Coin I highly recommend is Monero.  You will have to think through how much privacy you need, and how you can obtain Monero coin without there being a record of that transaction (or, purchase small amounts of another coin, like Bitcoin, and transfer it to a subaccount of your Monero wallet).
