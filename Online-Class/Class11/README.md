### 
Biometrics are body measurements, and calculations, which are used to provide unique identification of a person, which can be used as an access mechanism to data, physical locations, etc.  Examples include: finger print readers, iris eye scans, and facial recognition.  The idea behind such access mechanisms is that they are 100% unique, and can't be circumvented by hackers.  But this couldn't be further from the truth.

### Dangers 
Since some very smart people have found ways to circumvent many of these biometric access mechanisms, it is not a very good idea to utilize them to access your phone, computer, home, vehicle, or safes.  Also, you cannot change your eye, face, or fingerprint (so if your identity is compromised/stolen, you cannot simply change something about your body, like you can do with a password or PIN).  By avoiding Biometrics to access your phone, you can prevent unintended access (or coercion) as you are less likely to be coerced into giving someone your PIN instead of having your finger placed on your phone against your will (or while you are sleeping).

### Solution
Do not use biometrics to secure any device or data.  Always use a PIN (6 or more numbers) and change it periodically.  If you are afraid of forgetting this number, store it on a piece of paper in a fireproof safe and/or in your password manager (like LastPass) as a secure/encrypted note.
