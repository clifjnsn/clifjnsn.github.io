# VPN (Virtual Private Network) 

### What is it?
When your computer connects to a website, or other service on the internet, the information which is transmitted isn't always encrypted, your unique IP address (and location) are recorded by the website/service you connect to, and every server/service between you and them (ie. ISP - Internet Service Provider, DNS servers, switches/routers).  VPN (Virtual Private Network) is an encrypted network which directs your traffic through the VPN server, and provides the internet server/service with the IP address and location of the VPN servers(s), and not yours.  This enables you to be more annonymous when you are connecting to servers on the internet.

### Disadvantages
You must trust the company/organization who is providing your VPN service, as they are the holders of your encryption keys, and can decrypt your traffic, and can log/track your actual physical IP address (and location).  My suggestion is that you find a VPN provider which doesn't log your information (even if they report that they will not provide log information to any authorities/subpoenas).

Another disadvantage is that the act of encrypting your data requires increased processing power on your computer/phone, and will make your experience on that website/service slower.

## Suggested VPN Provider
Here is an [Article](https://proprivacy.com/vpn/comparison/best-no-logs-vpns) which makes some recommendations for "no log" VPN providers.  My suggestion is for [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/secure-vpn/) (the same group which provides the secure/encrypted e-mail service: Protonmail - which I recommended).  There are 2 reasons I can recommend Protonmail/ProtonVPN:  1.  They are located in Switzerland (which has better privacy laws), and 2.  They have been subpoena'd and have refused to release the information/access to the email accounts.  WARNING:  Their email servers to do log IP addresses which access them, and they are required by law to provide that information when subpoena'd, so their recommendation is that you use their VPN service to insure annonymity.
