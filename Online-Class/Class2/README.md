# Protecting Your Personal Computer (Cont'd)

### The Browser Wars
In the mid-1990's, the internet had it's first war.  It was a war for you allegiance, and attention.  Companies and people were going online, and surfing this new World Wide Web.  It was believed by developers, and some companies, that whomever controlled the portal to the internet would rule the internet.  This portal was the software we used to "surf the net" - the Web Browser.  Contenders were:

- Netscape Navigator (then Netscape Communicator)
- Microsoft's Internet Explorer
- NCSA Mosaic
- and, AOL (browser only available for customer's of AOL's internet service)

As it turned out, whomever controlled the browser, didn't control the internet.  Search engines were created to organize, and make information easier to locate.  Some of the first search engines included:

- Yahoo!
- Infoseek
- Lycos
- Altavista
- Ask Jeeves
- Google

The browser was a requirement to browse the internet, and to make purchases, but if you didn't know who carried the product you were looking for, who had the best price, then you needed a way to search for those answers.  The internet wars were really heating up now.  It seemed that these search engine providers/companies were providing this searching capability for free, and the search engine companies began making deals with the creators of the browsers for which search engine would be the default one, and if a bookmark for their search engine would be included by a default install of their browser software.  They were actually paying the developers of the browsers money, for these privileges.

### Why would they do that?  
How are these search engine companies making money?  Users of these search engines began noticing that "related" advertisements would appear next to, and among their search results.  That seems fair, and like a good way to make some money - paid advertising.  If that were as far as it went, I think most people would have been fine with it, and not felt tracked, harassed, had their privacy invaded, and feel like a product.  Do you think I'm exaggerating or taking this too far?  I'm not.  Google began offering other "free" services: Gmail, Google Docs, Google Maps, Android phone operating system, etc. and these "free" services keep you connected to their servers for longer periods of time, allowing you movements to be tracked. 

### Why track you?
Because Google is not a technology company, they are an advertising/marketing company, and they know that the longer they can keep people on their websites/servers, the more information they can collect on those people, and figure out what their likes/dislikes are, where they shop, who their friends are, where they travel, etc.

### How is this accomplished?  
They use their search engine, to index your email, your searches, your clicks, your documents (yes, even that household budget file in Google Docs).  

### How does this help?
The more they learn about the consumers who are using their products, the more directed advertising they can present on their products.  When companies pay for advertising, they want to maximize their return on investment (ROI), but it has always been difficult to measure that when advertising is done in newspapers, TV, and radio.  How do you figure out your conversion rate?  This was usually done with surveys, and product registrations, which rely on the consumer providing information about where they heard about the product, and where they ultimately purchased it.  But, this didn't tell them which ads (and mediums) were most effective.  Google, has all of this information about each consumer, so they can sell advertisements which are targeted directly to consumers who have already shown an interest in a particular product, or activity (or something related to it, or - even creepier - has a set number of common factors with a group of other consumers, who ultimately had an interest in, and purchased, a certain product).  They can also track each click (on their websites, and their ads), and provide even more detailed information and marketing to their customers (the ones paying for the advertisements).  

Then, they started paying other websites, to host their ads (but embedded in those ads, were trackers - so that they knew how often, and who, clicked on that ad).  All of that information, from every single web page that hosted even a single Google ad, was funneled back to Google's main computers, attached to your Google Account, and used to control what ads you saw, not only while you were using Google's "free" services, but almost every single website, and web page, on the internet.

### Why it Matters?
Your privacy is being invaded.  You are being tracked.  When you listen to the radio, or watch TV, the broadcaster doesn't know your race, sex, ethnicity, likes/dislikes, physical location, and running history of purchases and which commercials you paid attention to; or which ones you went to the kitchen to for a snack.  We are told that the information is "anonymized", and that it isn't tied directly to you, but they have enough information to track you right into your home.  Google has a bad track record for responding to requests for access to, and providing data to the police and other governmental agencies, whenever asked.

### What can you do to surf the internet more anonymously?
In the 1990's and early 2000's, it used to be pretty easy.  

- Don't be logged into your Google account while visiting other sites.
- Erase your cookies and clear your history frequently
- Use an Ad blocker extension in your browser

It's not enough anymore.  The most popular browser used on the internet is now Chrome (provided by Google).  Android phones are tied with Apple for popularity.  Google maps, Gmail, and other apps/services are often installed on many iPhones.  Google owns Nest (the smart home device company), Fitbit (health tracker), and sell their own home (always listening) Google assistant (like the Amazon Alexa).

### Searching alternative
When looking for alternative companies and products, look for companies which are upfront about what they do with the data they collect on you (if they collect any at all).  I believe the best search engine available right now is [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com).  They don't track you, store anything about what you search for (or clicked on), and even though they make their income from advertising, they advertise like radio and TV (everyone sees the same advertisement).  The quality of the search results is equal to (or better) than the results provided by Google.  UPDATE:  DuckDuckGo has decided to demote content in their search results which it deems "misinformation" regarding the Russian / Ukraine conflict (https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/duck-duck-go-reverses-course-will-demote-russian-propaganda-in-search-results-014336389.html).  If this upsets you (as it does me - because it starts down a slippery slope), I am currently using [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com).

### Browser alternative
The current winner for browser for me is [Brave](https://brave.com).  Why does the browser matter?  Isn't there a plugin I can install that will protect me equally as well?  Short answer, no.  These extensions might block some ads, and some tracking, but since Google wrote Chrome, and their money is from tracking you, they have written their browser software to bypass those extensions, when the advertisement, and the tracking, is being done by a Google ad, or product.  By default (and without any extensions, or custom settings), Brave blocks Ads, trackers, integrates with IPFS (more later), and provides access to anonymous browsing via Tor (Dark Web).

We will cover more about privacy options and cell phones, but I will say this: the web browser I suggest for your cell phone is the "DuckDuckGo Browser".  Currently, they don't offer a browser for the home computer, and once they do, I might suggest that over the Brave browser. UPDATE: The DuckDuckGo browser is now getting into trouble for its relationship with Microsoft (https://reclaimthenet.org/breaking-down-duckduckgos-microsoft-tracking-controversy), and others are starting to wonder if their claims about privacy, and not-tracking, are even true for their search engine.  I no longer recommend their search engine, or their browser.  Use Brave on the Desktop, and Mobile.
