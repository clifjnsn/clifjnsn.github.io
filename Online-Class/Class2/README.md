# Protecting Your Personal Computer (Cont'd)

### The Browser Wars
I am starting out with information about protecting your Personal Computer, not because it is what you might use the most often, but because the concepts for protecting this computer will be much simpler than the concepts for protecting your Smart Phone - but we will get there in future classes.

### Why it Matters?
In the early 1980's, most computers in American households were not on the internet, or at least, they were not connected for very long.  Internet connectivity was a paid service, and the speed at which we connected, we were prevented from being connected 24/7, and there were not enough services where we could've spent that many hours.  During this period of time, Cyber-Security and hacking were happening, but on a very small scale, not for profit, and usually the target was some sort of governmental agency.

Today, our connections are 24/7, and very, very fast.  This enables anyone in the world, to attempt to connect to any server, website, or home computer in the world.  This massive increase in targets has enabled large numbers of people/groups to spend much time online, learning, practicing, and attempting to break into anything attached to the internet.  These attacks can take many forms, and for various motives.  Also, as spying between governments has evolved, the internet has played a large role in gathering information about enemies, allies, and their citizens.  This surveillance has grown in scope, for the United States, to include it's own citizens.  The NSA has agreements with most communications, and tech., companies to scan, collect, and save most of the SMS/Text messages, emails, and phone records for every communication within the United States, and many of the countries around the world.  The logic for such are large surveillance system is to protect the United States from enemies within, and abroad.  The danger is that with much power, comes much responsibility.  Our government hasn't shown itself to handle responsibility of this information, and power, very well - especially in that past few years.
