# Biometrics 

### What are they?
Biometrics are body measurements and calculations which are used to provide unique identification of a person, which can be used as an access mechanism to data, locations, etc.  Examples include: finger prints, iris eye scans, and facial recognition.  The idea behind such access mechanisms is that they are 100% unique, and can't be circumvented by hackers.  But this couldn't be further from the truth.

### Dangers 
Since some very smart people have found ways to circumvent many of these biometric access mechanisms, it is not a very good idea to utilize them to access your phone.  Also, you cannot change your eye, face, or fingerprint - and you are less likely to be coerced into giving someone your PIN instead of having your finger placed on your phone against your will (or while you are sleeping).

### Solution
Do not use biometrics to secure any device or data.  Always use a PIN (6 or more numbers) and change it periodically.  If you are afraid of forgetting this number, store it on a piece of paper in a fireproof safe and/or in your password manager (like LastPass) as a secure/encrypted note.
