Instead of following the bouncing ball of lies and deceipt, the FLCC
is providing proven treatment for COVID (both critial care in hospital
and at home care - early treatment).

For the at home care, you may want to substitute Quercetin supplements
for hydroxychloroquine (as this is over-the-counter, and is easier to
obtain)
