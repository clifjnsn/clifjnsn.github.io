# Stomping Mandated Vaccinations via a Religious Exemption
When faced with the demand of "take the jab" or "lose your income", what will you do?  If you sincerely believe that this jab is harmful to your body (more harmful than the risk of contracting the illness that it is supposed to protect you from - but actually doesn't), then you have the right to file for a "Religious Exemption".  In order to file an exemption with your employer, you most hold a sincere religious belief and state how this belief is violated by this jab.

This directory contains many examples, from many points of view.  Read through them, take the facts/style which best suites you, and your argument.  Submit this request in writing to your employer, and keep good records, including names and dates (send registered mail - to get copies of signatures when it was received).

If you need legal representation, a good source to contact would be:
