I seem to have lost my outline/list of topics/ideas regarding this class (damn paper), so I'll drop them here for safe keeping.


Areas to explore/examine:
* Facebook (social media in general)
* Video regarding privacy (Why worry, I have nothing to hide)
* email / encrypted, scanned, don't give your email away freely online, or post it (SPAM), throw away email addresses
* facial recognition
* free is never free (you are the product)
* censorship is at an all time high
* tracking/control
* Incognito doesn't block/hide anything (except on your own computer - be even then, not really)

Solutions:
* Crypto Party (https://www.cryptoparty.in/)
* Leaving social media platforms where you are tracked
* Actually reading the End-User-Agreements (EULA) - https://tosdr.org/
* Encryption
* VPN
* Products: DuckDuckGo, Protonmail, ProtonVPN, gab.com, Browser options
            Signal vs SMS, Backups, Operating Systems, DNS
* Decentralized Internet.  An internet not owned by corporations, but it's users

You are being tracked, you just don't realize it right now, but if you speak out against anything, you will regret allowing yourself to be
tracked.
